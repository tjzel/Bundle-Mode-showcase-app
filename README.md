This is an app that showcases the use of `react-native-worklets` Bundle Mode feature. To read more about this feature, [check the documentation](docs.swmansion.com/react-native-worklets/experimental/bundleMode). It uses `react-native-wgpu` as an example library that can be run on the Worklet Runtime in a plug-and-play fashion.

# Getting Started

## Installing dependencies

Install all the necessary dependencies with `yarn`.

```sh
yarn
```

If you have trouble with that step, it probably means that you need to enable `corepack` first:

```sh
corepack enable && yarn
```

## Step 1: Start Metro

First, you will need to run **Metro**, the JavaScript build tool for React Native.

To start the Metro dev server, run the following command from the root of your React Native project:

```sh
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Build and run your app

With Metro running, open a new terminal window/pane from the root of your React Native project, and use one of the following commands to build and run your Android or iOS app:

### Android

```sh
yarn android
```

### iOS

For iOS, remember to install CocoaPods dependencies (this only needs to be run on first clone or after updating native deps).

The first time you create a new project, run the Ruby bundler to install CocoaPods itself:

```sh
bundle install
```

Then, and every time you update your native dependencies, run:

```sh
bundle exec pod install
```

For more information, please visit [CocoaPods Getting Started guide](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html).

```sh
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see your new app running in the Android Emulator, iOS Simulator, or your connected device.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also build it directly from Android Studio or Xcode.
